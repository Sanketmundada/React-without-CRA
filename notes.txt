1. Role of webpack : It is going to bundle all of our modules together
2. Role of babel : Convert the jsx into normal javascript so that browser can understand it
3. Webpack and babel togetherly will create a single js file which we can give to browser for running it
4. Webpack will look at the entry point figure out all application module and combine it as single file
5. html-webpack-plugin will automatically generate index.html which will be having reference to our output js file
6. preset-env will transform class/functional components syntax to browser understandable funstions
7. preset-react will convert jsx to React.createElement(...)
8. webpack-dev-server can be helpful while development ( it uses local-cache nothing related with dist)
9. For adding tailwind-csswe need to remove style-loader
